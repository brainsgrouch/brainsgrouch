## üçí welcome to huckles lair !

  all other info can be found on strawpage (links located on both this account and my alt) . in the meantime , heres byi number 1 !


BYI #1 (*this is for ponytown : check straw for other stuff*) :
- I get really picky with whoever sends me a friend request, so please state WHY you wanted to friend me in the first place [EXCEPTIONAL IF WE KNOW EACH OTHER ALREADY]
- C+H freely !! I am now comfortable with cuds and I would appreciate if you did cuddle beside me :3 
- DO NOT invite me to your parties; I'm in a party with my disc friends and I'm not supposed to leave it : PLUS too afraid to ask cuz I've never left it at all n I get scared leaving parties sooooo
- I sometimes hide/use skins without the github placed , if you think a person with a specific skin is me , just ask .

 ,, have a smurfy tree day !
