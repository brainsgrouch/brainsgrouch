BYF (*this is for ponytown : check straw for other*) :
- I get really picky with whoever sends me a friend request, so please state WHY you wanted to friend me in the first place
- Please ask me if you'd like to C+H (*even when I have it in one of my skin names*), I often run away when someone's near
- DO NOT invite me to your parties; I'm in a party with my disc friends and I'm not supposed to leave it : PLUS too afraid to ask cuz I've never left it at all n I get scared leaving parties sooooo
